Solution : Most of the existing police complaint management systems that is physical ones are centralized which are prone to more attacks and vulnerable to a single point of failure.
This is a problem in a situation where a police officer refuses to file a complaint against influential people, users won’t have a proof of registering a complaint. 
Also, some systems give high privileges to the police rendering it vulnerable to tampering. The drawbacks of existing systems highlight the need for a transparent and portable G2C e-governance framework where a user doesn’t have to forcibly trust the police department.Our product caters that need of decentralised transparent complaint system so that no crime go unreported.
